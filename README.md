  WEBPACK

  Webpack takes all of our assets and outputs them to a production-ready bundle

  -  Bundles JavaScript files into one file, minimizing http requests
  - Process SASS / LESS files into CSS and only use them where needed
  - Convert JSX or ES2015 into vanilla JS which browsers understand
